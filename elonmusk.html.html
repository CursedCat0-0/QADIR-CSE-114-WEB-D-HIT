    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p style="font-family:Serif;">Elon Musk is a visionary entrepreneur, engineer, and inventor known for founding and leading several high-profile companies. Born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk moved to the United States to pursue higher education at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned degrees in economics and physics. His career took off in the 1990s with the creation of Zip2, an online city guide, which he sold for nearly $300 million.
In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online payment company, which later became PayPal after a merger. PayPal was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion, and Musk used the profits to pursue ambitious ventures. In 2002, he founded SpaceX, with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars. SpaceX has since become a leader in space exploration, achieving significant milestones such as reusable rockets and the Crew Dragon spacecraft.
Musk also took the helm at Tesla Motors, where he has been instrumental in revolutionizing the electric vehicle industry. Under his leadership, Tesla became the world's most valuable automaker, pushing boundaries with innovations in electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy solutions.
In addition to SpaceX and Tesla, Musk founded or co-founded several other ventures, including Neuralink, which focuses on brain-computer interface technology, and The Boring Company, which aims to revolutionize transportation infrastructure.
Musk's bold vision and relentless drive have made him one of the most influential figures of the 21st century, transforming industries from space exploration to energy.
